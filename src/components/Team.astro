                Established in 2017 by the owner Ahmed Elallus, this thriving business is a testament to Ahmed’s passion for the art of barbering. With over 26 years of experience, Ahmed’s journey began when he was 14, supported by his family and friends who helped him open his first shop in his home town at the age of 18. After some time Ahmed moved to Ireland where he opened his A class barbers, located in the heart of Waterford City.
